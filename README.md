## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
olution
A Smart Crop Advisory System (mobile + web + IVR platform) that combines AI, IoT, and localized knowledge to provide farmers with real-time, actionable insights.

Farmers input or upload soil test reports / crop info.

AI analyzes soil type, crop stage, and local weather.

Generates personalized advisories (fertilizer dose, irrigation schedule, pest alerts).

Farmers can upload crop/pest images → AI detects diseases and suggests treatment.

Provides mandi prices & government schemes updates.


How it Addresses the Problem:

Eliminates guesswork & dependency on shopkeepers.

Bridges digital divide with voice + regional languages.

Promotes eco-friendly & profitable farming.


Innovation and Uniqueness:

Voice-first app (supports illiterate farmers).

AI-driven pest diagnosis via photo upload.

Real-time hyperlocal weather & soil insights.

Gamified farmer learning (points, rewards for eco-friendly practices).

## Technical Approach
Technologies to be used,

Frontend: React Native (mobile app), HTML5/React.js (web)

Backend: Python (Django/Flask/FastAPI)

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch (disease detection, predictive models)

NLP: Google Translate API / IndicNLP for multilingual support

Voice Support: Google Speech-to-Text + Text-to-Speech (regional languages)

APIs: IMD weather data, Government mandi price APIs, Soil health card integration

Hardware (optional IoT): Low-cost soil moisture sensors, weather stations


Methodology & Process (Flow):

1. Data Collection (Soil, weather, crop stage, user input).


2. AI/ML Engine analyzes & predicts advisories.


3. Advisory Delivery → App/Chatbot/Voice calls.


4. Farmer Feedback → System improvement.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility:

Technically possible with existing AI/ML & cloud infrastructure.

India already has open APIs for weather & mandi prices.

Can integrate with government schemes (PM-Kisan, Soil Health Card).


Potential Challenges & Risks:

Digital illiteracy among older farmers.

Poor internet in rural areas.

Trust-building in technology.


Strategies to Overcome:

Offline mode + SMS/IVR advisories.

Partnerships with NGOs & Krishi Vigyan Kendras for training.

Collaborations with state agriculture departments to boost adoption.

## Impact and Benefits
Impact on Target Audience:

Small farmers get trusted, scientific, and localized advice.

Reduced costs due to optimized inputs.

Increased yield & income for rural households.


Benefits:

Social: Empowers rural communities, reduces exploitation.

Economic: Higher farmer income, reduced input wastage.

Environmental: Reduced chemical overuse, sustainable agriculture.
